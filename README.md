# Face Detection For Python using ONNX

This package implements parts of GoogleÂ®'s [**MediaPipe**](https://mediapipe.dev/#!) models in pure Python (with a little help from Numpy and PIL) without `Protobuf` graphs and with minimal dependencies (just [**ONNX**](https://onnx.ai/onnx/api/) and [**Pillow**](https://python-pillow.org/)).


## Credits
This is a fork of a repo by [patlevin](https://github.com/patlevin) who did all the heavy lifting. Credits to [patlevin](https://github.com/patlevin) for the majority of this code. \

## Models and Examples

The package provides the following models:

* Face Detection

* Face Landmark Detection

## Motivation

The package doesn't use the graph approach implemented by **MediaPipe** and
is therefore not as flexible. It is, however, somewhat easier to use and
understand and more accessible to recreational programming and experimenting
with the pretrained ML models than the rather complex **MediaPipe** framework.

Here's how face detection works and an image like shown above can be produced:

```python
from fdlite import FaceDetection, FaceDetectionModel
from fdlite.render import Colors, detections_to_render_data, render_to_image 
from PIL import Image

image = Image.open('group.jpg')
detect_faces = FaceDetection(model_type=FaceDetectionModel.BACK_CAMERA)
faces = detect_faces(image)
if not len(faces):
    print('no faces detected :(')
else:
    render_data = detections_to_render_data(faces, bounds_color=Colors.GREEN)
    render_to_image(render_data, image).show()
```

While this example isn't that much simpler than the **MediaPipe** equivalent,
some models (e.g. iris detection) aren't available in the Python API.

Note that the package ships with five models:

* `FaceDetectionModel.FRONT_CAMERA` - a smaller model optimised for
  selfies and close-up portraits; this is the default model used
* `FaceDetectionModel.BACK_CAMERA` - a larger model suitable for group
 images and wider shots with smaller faces
* `FaceDetectionModel.FULL` - a model best suited for mid range images,
  i.e. faces are within 5 metres from the camera

If you don't know if you need `FULL` of `BACK_CAMERA`, use the `BACK_CAMERA` as it is most versatile.

## Installation

The latest version be installed via:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/seppe-intelliprove/face-detection-onnx
```

The package can be also installed from source by navigating to the folder
containing `pyproject.toml` and running

```sh
pip install .
```
